* Change board's build_from_deck method to create tableaus the "real" way
* Create method to pretty-print the solution
* Create main file so solver can be run from the command line
* Find a better way to handle the <=> operator for the solver nodes
* See if algorithm gem's tree is any faster than rbtree gem's for SortedQueue
